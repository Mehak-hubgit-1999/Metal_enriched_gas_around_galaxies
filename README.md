In this project, data analysis using Python is performed on high-dimensional spectral datasets (FITS format) from the MUSE instrument of the Very Large Telescope (VLT), Chile, to detect weak absorption lines in noisy environments, applying NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Astropy for signal processing, statistical analysis, and data visualization.
